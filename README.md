### What I learned

I learnt more about CSS , the selector and some flexbox.I also learnt about html block positioning

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```



### Continued development

I will be focusing and practicing more of css,css flexbox and grid.Also html.
